The front-end space is exhausing. It moves too fast, its scope is too wide, and it won’t wait around for you to keep up. It’s hard. One thing that makes it eaiser is writing about it all — the problem solving, the tinkering with new technologies, the rubber duck attempts to wrap your head around a concept. All of it. I’ve been trying to be more diligent about this, and I’ve been seeing clear benefits as a result. Here are a few reasons you should too:

**You’ll understand why your solutions solve your problems.**

It’s easy to stumble through an implementation that solves a problem and move on. It’s hard to get why that implementation works in the first place, and why it's best for your problem over some other solution. If there’s anything that distinguishes a developer from an engineer, it’s this. so, slow down, break it down, and write it down. You’ll find satisfaction in understanding why your code works, and soon enough, you’ll be solving problems more efficiently before they happen, rather than patching them up after they’ve struck.

**You’ll become your own resource.**

It’s startling how often I find myself facing a problem, only to remember that I’ve already solved & written about something like it in the past, with even just a thread of overlap. When you write, you become a resource to your future self. It’ll save you time, you’ll get all the credit, and it’ll make that writing feel even more worthwhile.

**You’ll look alive.**

When developers don’t consistently show up and contribute in some way (blogging, open-sourcing, teaching, tweeting, _anything else_), they look dead -- professionally dead, in an always-growing-and-contributing-in-your-craft sort of way. When you write, you get points for showing up, and that’s not a bad thing. Showing up means you care enough to contribute, even if what you contribute is small or useless to anyone else. It also means people will start to notice and trust you. It's easier to trust someone who makes small, regular, even unimpressive contributions over an ultra-genius who keeps their insight to themselves.

That said, you’ll be surprised who might benefit from what you publish. Your problems aren’t unique, and that small, crappy post might help someone else cut some corners, avoiding the lengthy process you had to endure to get to a solution or understand something.  

## Skip Draft Mode, Punch “Publish”

Quit fretting about your word count, outline, humor, or lack of experience. Stop caring about your readers so much that you’re too paralyzed to make a move. Jot down your jumbled, incoherent thoughts, _ship_ them, and clean them up later if you need. There’s a thing I heard Chris Coyier say when encouraging people to blog: “write the post you’d Google to find.” I like that. Write for your _own_ stake. You’ll be better off for it, and others will too.
