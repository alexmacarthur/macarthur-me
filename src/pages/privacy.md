## My Policy Behind My Privacy Policy
I refuse to make you read through pages and pages of boring text about a policy that does nothing but trick you into not reading it. Because I have every intention of protecting your privacy, I have made our privacy policy clear and concise enough that you might actually read it and feel comfortable using this site.

## Collected Information
No information that may personally identify you as an individual is collected through this service. I don't really care who you are; I just want you to benefit from what I've built or written.

## That's About It
If you have questions about any of this, [contact me](/contact).
