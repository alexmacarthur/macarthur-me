I'm husband to Hannah, dad to Autumn & Pippa, and web developer for [Dave Ramsey](https://www.daveramsey.com) in Nashville, TN. We moved here in 2015 from Minnesota, where "soda" is just shorthand for the stuff you mix with vinegar to create a volcano for a junior high science fair.

I specialize in building custom WordPress and JavaScript applications that meet the unique needs of those I'm serving. I'm interested in helping you too. [Let's connect](/contact) to get the process started. 

To stay updated on what I'm building and/or blabbing about, follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/amacarthur) and [GitHub](https://github.com/alexmacarthur).
