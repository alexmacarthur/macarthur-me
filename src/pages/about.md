#### I'm a web developer for [Dave Ramsey](https://www.daveramsey.com) in Nashville, TN.
My family and I moved here in 2015 from Minnesota, where "soda" is just shorthand for the stuff you mix with vinegar to create a volcano for a junior high science fair. I love what I do here, and it's a privilege to do it for a mission that matters. 

#### I can help you build your next website or digital tool.
I specialize in building custom WordPress and JavaScript applications, as well as providing consultation to help you improve or troubleshoot something you already have. Things like this:

* Building a custom, performant WordPress theme for your small business. 
* Constructing an interactive JavaScript application for your clients.
* Optimizing the front end performance of your slow website.
* Developing a WordPress plugin to integrate with your existing website. 
* Helping you figure out why Google seemingly hates your website.

That list isn't exhaustive. If you need some help, [let's connect](/contact) to get the process started.
